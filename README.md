# Hey up! 👋

I'm Paul, a full stack developer from [Manchester, England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester) with 20 years of building for the web.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me in the curry cafes of [Rusholme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rusholme) more often than is probably healthy, or watching [Manchester City](https://www.mancity.com/). 🍛⚽

## What I believe

I care about building software I can actually trust - code I can change without fear. Learned how to do that at the [BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport), where TDD was mandatory. Took me a while to get it right. The trick is testing behaviour, not implementation details (Ian Cooper's talk below nails this). Once that clicked, everything changed.

**TDD is the reason I'm never stressed.** I've been doing it for over a decade now and genuinely can't imagine working any other way.

I'm a [product engineer](https://feedbackdriven.dev/) - not just someone who writes code, but someone who cares deeply about solving real customer problems. Great software comes from tight feedback loops: technical feedback through TDD and CI/CD, and business feedback through close collaboration with stakeholders.

I write about this at **[feedbackdriven.dev](https://feedbackdriven.dev/)** and occasionally share thoughts on my **[YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgc0-m2RACQe1VVT_0dkH1Q)**.

The talk that changed everything for me: [TDD, Where Did It All Go Wrong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ05e7EMOLM) by Ian Cooper.

## What I'm building

### [Scenarist](https://scenarist.io)

A testing framework that lets you run Playwright tests against your **real** server - Server Components, routes, middleware, business logic - while mocking only external APIs. Test reality, control the rest.

### [.dotfiles](https://github.com/citypaul/.dotfiles)

My development environment setup, including a comprehensive **CLAUDE.md** framework for AI-assisted development. It's become a reference for developers practicing TDD with AI tools - 418+ stars and growing.

### [mac-dev-machine-setup](https://github.com/citypaul/mac-dev-machine-setup)

Ansible automation to set up a Mac from scratch. One command, fully configured dev environment.

## The journey

Started in 2005 building a Pro Evolution Soccer league website in PHP (tables for layout, the lot). Since then:

- **[Chillingo/EA](https://www.ea.com/ea-studios/chillingo)** - Mobile gaming
- **[BBC Sport](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport)** - 4½ years, where I discovered TDD
- **[Sky](https://www.sky.com/)** - Homepage redesign
- **[Equal Experts](https://www.equalexperts.com/)** - Consulting with brilliant people
- **Now** - Contracting, mostly TypeScript/Node.js/React, infrastructure on Azure

## The stack

**Languages:** TypeScript (strict mode, always), JavaScript
**Frontend:** React, Next.js
**Backend:** Node.js, Express
**Testing:** Jest, Vitest, Playwright, React Testing Library
**Infrastructure:** Azure, Terraform, Docker
**Philosophy:** TDD, CI/CD, immutability, behaviour over implementation
