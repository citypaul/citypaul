### About Me

I am a **Product Engineer** based in Manchester, UK.

My background spans roles at **BBC Sport**, **Sky**, **EA**, and **Equal Experts**, but my focus has evolved beyond just writing code. I help teams bridge the gap between technical excellence and business value. I believe strongly that technical excellence matters, but that the real proof that you have a quality foundation is software that remains easy to change over time.

I believe that **happy, psychologically safe teams** are the only ones capable of sustaining high performance.

Great software comes from **tight feedback loops** and **close collaboration**. Collaboration happens both among engineers (often via pair programming) and between engineers and the business. We're here to build successful products in the market, and it's our job to help with that.

I don't just build features; I build systems that allow teams to validate business assumptions quickly and safely.

### The Philosophy: Feedback-Driven Development

I am currently capturing my methodology at **[feedbackdriven.dev](https://feedbackdriven.dev)**. My approach is built on three core beliefs:

- **Market Discovery:** Validate assumptions _before_ and _during_ the build. Don't guess - measure.
- **Technical Excellence:** TDD and CI/CD are not just "quality" tools - they are **speed** tools. They enable the safety required to deploy rapidly.
- **Collaboration:** Real-time pairing and cross-functional teams beat asynchronous handovers every time.

### Combining XP with AI

I am actively experimenting with how **Extreme Programming (XP)** techniques apply to AI tools like **Claude Code**.

Rather than letting AI generate code blindly, I use it as a pair programmer that operates within strict **TDD** cycles. I've found that by providing clear context (via my `.dotfiles` setup) and enforcing test-first constraints, we can use these tools to ship faster without sacrificing safety or understanding.

### Technical Stack

I specialize in the JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem and modern infrastructure, focusing on tools that enable rapid iteration.

### Featured Projects

- **[scenarist](https://github.com/citypaul/scenarist)**: A tool for E2E testing Node.js apps with instant scenario switching - mocking only what you need.
- **[.dotfiles](https://github.com/citypaul/.dotfiles)**: My personal development environment, optimized for AI-assisted workflows (featuring my `CLAUDE.md` context setup).
- **[feedbackdriven.dev](https://feedbackdriven.dev)**: A manifesto and resource for building software that matters.

### Non-Technical

When I'm not obsessing over feedback loops, I'm usually obsessing over **Manchester City** ⚽.

I also have a serious dedication to Indian food. You will often find me exploring the curry cafes of Manchester, always on the hunt for the perfect dish.
