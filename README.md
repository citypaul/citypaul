# Hey up!

I'm Paul üëã

I'm a full stack web developer from [Manchester, England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester). I've been doing web dev in one form or another since 2005, when I created a website that let players of the game [Pro Evolution Soccer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Evolution_Soccer) create leagues against each other. That was all in PHP, and it was back when building websites using tables was still the norm! Things have certainly come a long way since then! ü§£

My career so far has taken me to Electronic Arts, where I worked for [Chillingo](https://www.ea.com/ea-studios/chillingo) for a while. Loved working there! Then I moved to the BBC, where I worked on the [BBC Sport Website](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport) for 4 1/2 years. I left the BBC to try my hand at contracting, where I started out at BSKYB, working on various things for them, including a new design of [their homepage](https://www.sky.com/).

After leaving Sky I worked with some great people at [Equal Experts](https://www.equalexperts.com/), and loved my time there also!

## Technical interests

I'm a huge fan of TDD (test driven development), as I fundamentally believe it can help to continue writing software with confidence over time. I'd highly recommend [this great talk by Ian Cooper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ05e7EMOLM) on the subject.

I fundamentally believe in [CI/CD](https://www.synopsys.com/blogs/software-security/agile-cicd-devops-difference/) and all the benefits it brings, when combined with great tests of course!

I use Javascript and Typescript mostly, with a focus on node.js and modern front ends like React.

I also love dabbling with the infrastructure type stuff, and have used Terraform and Azure recently.

Actually most of my current work for my current (and previous) clients are in Azure, so the charts you see on this page are currently based on personal stuff I've been doing, not professional stuff, as it's all in Azure and not Github.

## Non-technical stuff

I'm a big fan of Manchester City, and I love curry to a ridiculous extent. I eat Indian food very often, and when we're not in lockdown you'll often find me in the curry cafes in Manchester. üçõ
