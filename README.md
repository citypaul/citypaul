### 🚀 About Me

I am a **Product Engineer** based in Manchester, UK.

My background spans roles at **BBC Sport**, **Sky**, **EA**, and **Equal Experts**, but my focus has evolved beyond just writing code. I help teams bridge the gap between technical excellence and business value.

I believe that great software comes from **tight feedback loops** and **close collaboration**. I don't just build features; I build systems that allow teams to validate business assumptions quickly and safely.

### 🧠 The Philosophy: Feedback-Driven Development

I am currently capturing my methodology at **[feedbackdriven.dev](https://feedbackdriven.dev)**. My approach is built on three core beliefs:

- **Market Discovery:** Validate assumptions _before_ and _during_ the build. Don't guess—measure.
- **Technical Excellence:** TDD and CI/CD are not just "quality" tools—they are **speed** tools. They enable the safety required to deploy rapidly.
- **Collaboration:** Real-time pairing and cross-functional teams beat asynchronous handovers every time.

### 🛠 Technical Stack

I specialize in the JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem and modern infrastructure, focusing on tools that enable rapid iteration.

### 🍛 Non-Technical

When I'm not obsessing over feedback loops, I'm usually obsessing over **Manchester City** ⚽.

I also have a serious dedication to Indian food. You will often find me exploring the curry cafes of Manchester, always on the hunt for the perfect dish.
